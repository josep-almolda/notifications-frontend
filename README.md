## description

this is a very simple web page that uses `react` + `redux`, combined with other
dependecies like `redux-thunk` to load a list of notifications from the api created
in the other repository:

https://github.com/josep-almolda/assesment

notifications can be retrieved by specific user, or you can get all of them selecting `All`
